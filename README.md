# dotfiles
These dotfiles have been tested in Nix and OSX. If you want to try them, I would fork this repo, review, and remove any configuration you don't want.

## Usage
### Install
To install, download and run.
```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gesquive/dotfiles/main/.local/bin/bootstrap_dotfiles.sh -O -)"
```
